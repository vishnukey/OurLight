# The Great Unknown

- Under the oceans
- Low visibility/exploration
- Exploring the "great unknown"
- Space? 
- heavy vastness themes here, gotta be "great"
- what is unkown? Is it a mystery? Can it be known? 
- Exploration vs Discovery
        - Puzzle?
        - Adventure?
- Is it a platformer? 

- Idea:
        - Top-down view, walking around with a flashlight, things only visible in light cone
        - Infite map
        - Can piece together what happened, make better lights, campfires, etc.
        - Find resources, craft to make new items
        - Enemies? Threats? 
        - "Centre" area already lit, has some resources, but not enough
        - manage NPCs?
