# Plan

## The Great Unknown

## Our Light

- Top Down Orthographic view
- Play character that can move around
- Camera that follows the player, but maybe not exactly
- Campfire at spawn, giving a circle of light
- can't see anything if it has no light on it
        - Might need a custom lighting shader on everything...
- Random world
        - populate with trees, other campsites
- Crafting System
        - Tree => Wood
        - Wood => Torches
        - Scrap => Flashlight
                => Sword
                => gun? 
- Different Items
        - Flashlight
        - Torch (can be placed on the ground)
        - Sword (melee)
        - Gun (ranged)
- NPC's
        - Do something...
        - A few spawn at the starting camp
        - Finding in the world, will follow you back to camp
- Enemies
        - Will kill NPC's
        - Will attack player
        - Get harder the farther away you go?
        - Try not to lead them back to camp
- UI
        - Health bar
        - Inventory? Maybe
        - Crafting window? Maybe. 
        - Starting Screen, time permitting
